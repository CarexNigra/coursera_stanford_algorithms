    "2. or non-physical network is connected: co-staring actors\n",
    "    * the nodes correspond to actors and actresses, \n",
    "    * an edge between two nodes, if they played a role in a common movie. \n",
    "    * an undirected graph,\n",
    "    * So versions of this movie network you should be able to find publicly available on the web, and there's lots of fun questions you can ask about the movie network. \n",
    "        * what's the minimum number of hops ( = edges = movies that two people both played a role in) from one actor to another actor, \n",
    "        * so perhaps the most famous statistic that's been thought about with the movie is the Bacon Number. \n",
    "            * So this refers to the fairly ubiquitous actor Kevin Bacon, \n",
    "            * the question the Bacon Number of an actor is defined as the minimum number of hops you need in this movie graph to get to Kevin Bacon. \n",
    "            *  Bacon Number is fundamentally not just about any path, but actually shortest paths, the minimum number of edges you need to traverse to get from one actor to Kevin Bacon. \n",
    "3. shortest paths to go from 1 point to another = driving direction\n",
    "4. formulate a plan of how to get from an initial state to some goal state: \n",
    "    * sudoku\n",
    "        * directed graph\n",
    "        * nodes = partially comleted puzzles\n",
    "        * edge = directed, 1 previousy empty cell is filled with one number\n",
    "    * robotic hand manipulated to grab an object\n",
    "5. computing connectivity information about graphs = connected components = pieces of graphs\n",
    "    * undirected graphs = easy clustering euristics derives from connectivity\n",
    "    * directed graphs = more subtile = structure of the web\n",
    "     \n",
    "A lot of different approaches to searching a graph. Here we focus on two\n",
    "* Breadth first search\n",
    "* Depth first search\n",
    "  \n",
    "Goals: \n",
    "* We define a source (starting vertex) and the goal is to fing anything findable from it\n",
    "* We want to do it efficiently: \n",
    "    * looking at either each piece of the graph only once for a small cost number of times.\n",
    "    * So looking for running time which is linear on the size of the graph that is big O(m+n).\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Generic algorithm**  \n",
    "(given grapg G, vertex s, no condition on edges m (there could be > or < than vertex))\n",
    "\n",
    "* look at either each piece of the graph only once =>\n",
    "    * we're gonna remember whether or not we explored it before. \n",
    "    * we need one Boolean per node \n",
    "    * (1) we will initialize it by having everything unexplored except S, our starting point we'll have it start off as explored\n",
    "* And it's useful to think of the nodes thus far as being in some sense territory conquered by the algorithm.\n",
    "    * there's going to be a frontier in between the conquered and unconquered territory. \n",
    "    * the goal of the generic outcome is that each step we supplement the conquered territory by one new node, assuming that there is one adjacent to the territory you've already conquered\n",
    "        * (2) while possible: \n",
    "            * choose and edge (гбм) with u explored and v unexplored\n",
    "            * if none, stop\n",
    "            * mark v explored\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim:**  \n",
    "at the termination of this algorithm the node v – explored <=> G has a path from s to v\n",

    "* this claim and the proof holds whether or not G is an undirected graph or a directed graph. \n",
    "* almost all of the things in this course about graph search: breadth first search, depth first search also\n",
    "* the one big difference: connectivity computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: \n",
    "* (=>) easy induciton on number of inerations\n",
    "* (<=) by contradiction:\n",
    "    * suppose G has a path p from s to v but v \n",
    "    * but v is unexplored at the end of the algorithm\n",
    "        * s for sure is explored since we initialize the algorithm this way\n",
    "        * we traverse this path from s to v: some points in the middle could be explored, some – not\n",
    "        * in the middle of this path there is an edge by which we move from an explored vertex to an unexplored at some point: \n",
    "        * <=> (u,w) belonging to path where u - explored, w - unexplored\n",
    "        * u can be an s and w can be a v\n",
    "        * How is it possible that an algorithm terminated, but there is still this edge (u,v)\n",
    "        * generic search won't terminate without exploring w\n",
    "        * contradiction\n",
    "        * QED\n",
    "  \n",

    "    * there is a cut between explored and unexplored part woth crossing edges\n",
    "    * How to choose among frontier edges?\n",
    "* **Breadth-First-Search:**\n",

    "        * neighbors of S = Layer-1, \n",
    "        * Layer-2 will = nodes that are neighbors of Layer-1 but that are not already in layer 0 or 1\n",
    "        * So layer i+1, = nodes next to layer i that you haven't already seen yet. \n",
    "     * there's a close correspondence between these layers and **shortest path** distances.\n",
    "     * can also be used to compute **connected components** of an undirected graph in linear time O(n+m) if we use a correct data structure: a queue (FiFo)\n",
    "* **Depth-First-Search**\n",
    "    * A strategy of how you agressively explore a maze\n",
    "    * It's not, for example, very useful for computing shortest path information, but especially in directed graphs it's going to do some remarkable things for us. \n",
    "        * So, in directed acyclic graphs, so a directed graph with no directed cycles it will give us what's called the **topological ordering**. \n",
    "            * So it'll sequence the nodes in a linear ordering from the first to the last, so that all of the arcs of the directed graph go forward. \n",
    "            * So this is useful for example if you have a number of tasks that need to get completed with certain precedence constraints. \n",
    "        * Compute **connected components in directed graphs** (for undirected it doesn't mtter what to use) in O(n) time\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Time-wise**  \n",
    "* both of these are superb strategies for exploring a graph. \n",
    "* They're both linear time with very good constants. \n",
    "* DFS O(m+n) time in a graph with M edges and N vertices. \n",
    "* You do wanna use a different data structure reflecting the different search strategy. \n",
    "    * So, here because you're exploring aggressively, as soon as you get to a node you'll meet and you start exploring its neighbors, you wanna last-in first-out data structure, also known as a stack. \n",
    "    * Depth first search also admits a very elegant recursive formulation, and in that formulation, you don't even need to maintain a stack data structure explicitly, the stack is implicitly taken care of in the recursion.    "

    "* DFS on a node, is going to find everything findable from that node. \n",

    "     * Furthermore, the recursive call corresponding to the node v is going to finish, it's going to get popped off the program stack before that of u. \n",
    "     * The easiest way to see this is just to think about the recursive structure of depth-first search. \n",
    "         * So when you call depth-first search from u, that recursive call, that's going to make further recursive calls to all of the relevant neighbors including v, and u's call is not going to get popped off the stack until v's does beforehand. \n",
    "         * That's because of the last in, first out nature of a stack or of a recursive algorithm.\n",
    "         * So because v's recursive call finishes before that of u, that means it will be assigned a larger label than u. \n",

    "    * That means there cannot be any directed path from v all the way back to u. \n",

    "    *  Therefore, DFS invoked from v is not going to discover u. \n",
    "    * There's no directed path from v to u\n",

    "* Output: for each v belonging to V, compute L(v) = length of a shortest path s-v in G (ie sum of edge lengths)\n",
    "* Assumptions\n",
    "    * [For convinience]: assume that there is a directed path from S to every other vertex V in the graph, otherwise the shortest path distance is something we define to be plus infinity\n",
    "        * we can always detect which vertices are not reachable from S just in a preprocessing step using BFS or DFS, and then delete the irrelevant part of the graph\n",
    "        * Alternatively, Dijkstra's algorithm will quite naturally figure out what vertices there are paths to from S and which ones there are not, so this won't really come up. \n",
    "    * [Important]: we always focus on graphs where every length is non-negative (l_e >= 0 for any у belonging to E)\n",
    "        * paths can be thought of as more abstractly as a just sequence of decisions. \n",
    "        * for example, maybe you're engaging in financial transactions and you have the option of both buying and selling assets at different times. \n",
    "        * If you sell then you get some kind of profit and that would correspond to a negative edge length. \n",
    "        * So there are quite interesting applications in which negative edge lengths are relevant. \n",
    "        * If you are dealing with such an application, Dijkstra's algorithm is not the algorithm to use. \n",
    "        * But the most well-known dealing with such problems is called Bellman-Ford\n",
    "* BFS also calculates shoretest pathбиге only for a special case when length of every edge is = 1\n",
    "    * Say you have an edge that has length three. \n",
    "    * Why not just replace all the edges with a path of edges of the appropriate length? \n",
    "    * Now we have a network in which every edge has unit length and now we can just run breadth-first search. \n",
    "    * => Computing shortest paths with general edge weights reduces to computing shortest paths with unit edge weights? \n",
    "        * First comment: if all of the edge lengths were just small numbers, like 1, 2, and 3 and so on, this trick would work fine.\n",
    "        * The issue is when you have a network where the different edges can have very different lengths. \n",
    "        * If you start wantonly replacing single edges with these really long paths, you've blown up the size of your graph way too much. \n",
    "        * Even though BFS runs in linear time, it's now on this much larger graph. \n",

    "**The file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected weighted graph with 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. Each row consists of the node tuples that are adjacent to that particular vertex along with the length of that edge. For example, the 6th row has 6 as the first entry indicating that this row corresponds to the vertex labeled 6. The next entry of this row \"141,8200\" indicates that there is an edge between vertex 6 and vertex 141 that has length 8200. The rest of the pairs of this row indicate the other vertices adjacent to vertex 6 and the lengths of the corresponding edges.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task is to run Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on this graph, using 1 (the first vertex) as the source vertex, and to compute the shortest-path distances between 1 and every other vertex of the graph. If there is no path between a vertex v and vertex 1, we'll define the shortest-path distance between 1 and v to be 1000000.**\n",

    "**You should report the shortest-path distances to the following ten vertices, in order: 7,37,59,82,99,115,133,165,188,197. You should encode the distances as a comma-separated string of integers. So if you find that all ten of these vertices except 115 are at distance 1000 away from vertex 1 and 115 is 2000 distance away, then your answer should be 1000,1000,1000,1000,1000,2000,1000,1000,1000,1000. Remember the order of reporting DOES MATTER, and the string should be in the same order in which the above ten vertices are given. The string should not contain any spaces. Please type your answer in the space provided.**\n",

    "**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: This graph is small enough that the straightforward O(mn) time implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm should work fine. OPTIONAL: For those of you seeking an additional challenge, try implementing the heap-based version. Note this requires a heap that supports deletions, and you'll probably need to maintain some kind of mapping between vertices and their positions in the heap.**"
